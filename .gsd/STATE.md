> **Status**: Active (resumed 2026-02-23T11:13)
> **Resumption Command**: `/resume`

## Active Context
- **Phase 4 Completed**: The React Next.js 16 frontend is fully implemented. It features TradingView Lightweight charts for OHLCV visualization and client-side TF.js inference for instantaneous 3-day forecasting.
- **Git State**: Local repository is fully synced. Code pushed to `origin/main`.
- **Frontend Build**: Zero TypeScript errors.

## Next Step
1. User deploys the app by connecting the GitHub repository to a Vercel Hobby Tier project.
2. User configures the Vercel Environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).
3. App goes live.

## Open Issues
- None at this time.
